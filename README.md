# Introduction

This repository is to challenge myself to work with python code everyday and revisit the python basics using structure exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/python).

The [completed](https://github.com/kytcrystal/python-training/tree/main/completed) folder contains all the exercises that I have completed.
